This prototype is intended to test the behavior of IR LED/photodiode pairs at a variety of angles to narrow down the best method of obtaining measurements of water turbidity (direct opacity measurement/rayleigh scattering).

Each photodiode is connected to a transimpedance amplifier and broken out to a header for oscope/adc conversion. Everything should get wired up and then coated with epoxy so we can dunk it.
