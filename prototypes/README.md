----

[This prototype](https://github.com/JeremyRuhland/turbidity_sensor/tree/master/prototypes/rev0) is the original design [JeremyRuhland](https://github.com/JeremyRuhland) came up with without doing any research or testing, so it probably won't work. This will probably never see the water but some design aspects may be useful for further equipment.

Rev1
----

[This prototype](https://github.com/JeremyRuhland/turbidity_sensor/tree/master/prototypes/rev1) is designed for testing differences between opacity measurements and rayleigh scattering. It is described further in its own readme file.

Rev2
----

[This prototype](https://github.com/JeremyRuhland/turbidity_sensor/tree/master/prototypes/rev2) is designed for testing the utility of UV light based biofouling mitigation. It is described further in its own readme file.
