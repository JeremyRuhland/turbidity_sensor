Water Turbidity Sensor Project
==============================

Hackerbot labs would like to place a number of water turbidity sensor packages in dive sites around Puget Sound to provide up-to-date visibility and water temperature information.

The sensor string will be suspended between a weight and small buoy which will contain a battery, solar panels and communication antenna. The installations will be close to shore and will probably use local wifi or a LTE cellular data connection.

Research
--------

[This folder](https://github.com/JeremyRuhland/turbidity_sensor/tree/master/research) contains information and design specs related to the sensor packages and their installation.

Prototypes
----------

[This folder](https://github.com/JeremyRuhland/turbidity_sensor/tree/master/prototypes) contains schematics and code used for prototype systems intented to guide the design of the sensors and their housings.

Designs
-------

[This folder](https://github.com/JeremyRuhland/turbidity_sensor/tree/master/designs) contains possible designs for the production sensor strings.
